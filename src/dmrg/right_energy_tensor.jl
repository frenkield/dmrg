    LeftEnergyTensor

This struct represents the L-expression tensor given in expression 193 of
Schollw√∂ck.

This implementation can be improved by building each RightEnergyTensor
recursively. For example, the RightEnergyTensor for the 4th site/orbital
can be constructed by contracting the 5th RightEnergyTensor with the 4th
MPO tensor and the 4th MPS tensor.

TODO - build RightEnergyTensors recursively.
